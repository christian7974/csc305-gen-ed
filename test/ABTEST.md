# A/B Test Name: Light vs Dark Theme
## User Story Number: 6
## Metric (from the HEART grid): Happiness, Engagement
### Hypothesis:
As phones are starting to differentiate between a light mode versus a dark mode, it is important to understand what users like more. While a light theme may look nicer and gentle, a dark theme can come across as assertive and invite people to use our app. If we choose the wrong theme, even if our algorithm works flawlessly, people will still not use our app as they do not feel comfortable using it. My hypothesis is that since more apps are introducing a dark mode to their apps, it means that there is a desire to make your app have a darker theme as opposed to a lighter theme. 
We are going to measure our results by the amount of times a user opens our app. If a user does not open the app a lot, then that means they are opposed to the theme and do not like the theme.


### Experiment
The experiment will involve launching the app with a dark mode and a light mode (the users that get the theme will be random). We will see which users use the app longer between the dark and light themes measured by the amount of users over a range of a month.

### Variations
There is no real variation for this test, as the only two options are a light and dark theme. One idea we could try is to have the user pick which theme they would like to use for the app and keep both options open.

# A/B Test Name: More Search Parameters vs Old Search Parameters
## User Story Number: 7
## Metric (from the HEART grid): Task Success, Happiness 
### Hypothesis:
The initial version of the app will recommend classes based on the previous classes you have taken, the classes you expect to take and then give you courses based on the gen-ed sections that you are missing. While that is good enough to get you to graduate college, the idea is for the app to recommend you courses based on more factors than that (how difficult a course is/how difficult of a course that you want to take, etc.). Our hypothesis is that if there are more search parameters when a user wants to make a query, then that would allow for better search results to occur and people would want to use our app more if the suggestions they are getting is based off of more things that matter.

### Experiment
Our experiment would involve having an option in our search results called “Advanced Search”. Along with the basic parameters, the user would then be presented with new parameters including how difficult the course should be, who the professor should be and the rating of the course (this can be derived from crowd sourcing the courses or using a website like RateMyProfessor or Coursicle). We would check how many users make their query with the “Advanced Search” toggle on or off. If more people are using the advanced search and making more queries with the advanced search options, then that is an indication that more people favor having more parameters when making a search.

### Variations 
One variation we could test is which parameters that people use the most or least. That would allow us to make the search even better by getting rid of the parameters that people do not use (and that would reduce clutter on our UI).
