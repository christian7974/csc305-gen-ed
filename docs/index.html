                    As a college student, you have the option to take hundreds of General Education courses to experiment with a program of study, and that's great! Until you have
                    <strong>too</strong> many options. You end up taking too much time to create a schedule, and you may feel overwhelmed with the options. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    You may take a class that you regret or not choose the right courses to be able to graduate on time, and everyone wants to graduate on time!
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is where <strong>CoursiQuity</strong> comes in! We help you stay on track with your General Education Requirements, so all you have to worry about is taking
                    courses that you enjoy (don't worry, we'll soon create functionality to pick classes for you based on your interests)!

                    Right now, our app is currently in <strong>Internal Testing</strong>, meaning only a select amount of people can use our app and it is not a finished
                    product.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We hope to have the Internal Testing done soon so that we can start to have wide-scaled tests with more users.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, when our app is fully completed, it can be found in the Google Play Store.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For now, you can <a href="#test-app">test our app</a> here as a mobile web app!
