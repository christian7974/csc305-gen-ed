### Executive Summary
The problem our product addresses is the fact that picking interesting, worthwhile gen ed classes is very difficult in college. Students need to take so many gen ed classes in college in order to fulfill a plethora of requirements. Our product is a vitamin, as it appeals to the emotions of college students (a college student can take any and all gen ed classes that they please, however we want students to have gen ed classes that they enjoy).  

Our solution is to create an app that, given a list of completed courses, program of study and fields of interest/disinterest, provides interesting gen ed classes that minimize the total requirements for URI students in order to save time and money while also improving their educational experience.  

There is no similar idea for our project. While there are a lot of resources available to help students pick classes, there is no product that will produce a list of them quite like ours. The products for college students today are mostly read-only (for instance, in Rate My Professor, you enter in your school and see hundreds of reviews about professors at that school), whereas our app requires students to enter in information about themselves in order to give them recommended courses to take. While colleges may have search tools where you can look up general education courses, they lack actually recommending courses, which is what our product would excel at. Another tool that colleges may use advisors to help students choose classes, there are a lot of factors that can decrease their effectiveness (asking an advisor from a different department for help, them not being available, etc) which can cause students to choose the courses themselves which can lead to regretful decisions.  

The users of our product will be undergraduate college students who are unsure about which gen ed classes to take while in college. Our app can work for both Upperclassmen and Lowerclassmen, as every student takes gen ed/required courses at different times in their college career, making it important to appeal to both parties.  

Our market is mature, since there are a lot of products that students use while they are in college (Rate My Professor, Coursicle) which means that they have most of the market share. However, the idea of being recommended for college classes is something new and that market is growing. More students are going to college than ever before and colleges cannot keep up. This causes a lot of classes to become full quickly, having students scrambling to find easy and interesting gen ed courses.
