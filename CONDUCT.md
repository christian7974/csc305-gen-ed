## Decisions
Decisions will be made by majority. If more than half of our group approves a decision, then the team will move forward with that idea.

## Attendance
We expect all of our team members to be attentive and present at every meeting, unless the person gives at least a notice of one day that they will not be present at the meeting. However, it is best if we all try to make every meeting.

## Assignments
Assignments will be made as a team and will take into account each member's class schedule, extracirricular activities, or personal life.  
If a team member fails to complete an assignment or does the assignment poorly, it is up to that team member to alert the team that they could not complete the assignment or did it poorly and why it happened. The team member will then take time to correct their mistakes or complete the assignment before they take on a new task.

## Participation
We will ensure full participation by giving every team member the same amount of work (or around the same amount of work, however we will prevent it from being egregious). We will honor these strengths by accessing each team member's skills/strengths and assign tasks based on those strengths/skills and delegate tasks accordingly. If multiple team members are deficient in a task, they may be asked to work on assignments/tasks together as a smaller team.

## Meeting Times and Location/Mediums
We will meet on Zoom twice a week outside of the scheduled class and project times. Members who cannot make the meetings must alert the group no less than one day before the scheduled meeting. Failure to do so will result in disciplinary action by the team.

## Agenda and Minutes/Notes
Notes will be delegated to Christian, where he will create a Google Doc for each week and store the notes of each meeting, sectioned off by day and send that Google Doc to the team so they can be reviewed if someone was not present at the meeting or reinforce ideas mentioned at the meeting.

## Promptness
We expect everyone to be at least 5 minutes early to every in-person meeting (for online meetings, have your technology including but not limited to microphone, speakers and computer so as to prevent techincal difficulties). If you are late to the meeting, then you will have to stay the same amount of time after the meeting to have someone go over what you may have missed while you were gone.

## Conversational Courtesies
It is the team's job to be absolutely silent while someone else it talking and to save their thoughts until after that person has finished talking. Interrupting someone will not be tolerated. We also want to make everyone's voice heard, so we would like to hear everyone talk at least once before someone talks twice if possible.

## Enforcement/Feedback
We will enforce these rules as a team. It is everyone's job to make sure that everyone else follows these rules, and everyone will have the authority to let someone know if they are breaking any of the above rules/protocols.
